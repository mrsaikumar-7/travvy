### 3. Development Guidelines

#### Code Quality Standards
- Follow FastAPI best practices for async/await
- Use type hints throughout the codebase
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Write tests for all new functionality
- Follow the established service layer pattern

#### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for service classes
- Integration tests for API endpoints  
- End-to-end tests for user workflows
- Performance tests for AI processing
- WebSocket connection tests

#### Security Considerations
- Validate all user inputs with Pydantic models
- Implement proper authentication for all endpoints
- Use HTTPS in production
- Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Sanitize data before database operations

## 🎯 Key Implementation Notes

1. **All service methods are placeholders** - They need actual implementation with business logic
2. **Database operations are stubbed** - Connect to real Firestore and implement queries
3. **AI services need API integration** - Connect to actual Google Cloud AI services
4. **WebSocket functionality is basic** - Implement operational transforms for collaboration
5. **Celery tasks are shells** - Add real processing logic for each task type

## 📊 Performance Targets

- API Response Time: < 200ms for standard operations
- AI Trip Generation: < 3 minutes for complex itineraries
- WebSocket Latency: < 50ms for real-time updates
- Database Queries: < 100ms with caching
- Background Task Processing: Based on task complexity

## 🔄 Maintenance and Monitoring

- Structured logging is configured for all components
- Health check endpoints are available for monitoring
- Celery task monitoring via Flower interface
- Performance metrics collection framework is in place
- Automated cleanup and backup task scheduling

This project foundation provides a robust, scalable starting point for building the complete Travvy backend system according to the LLD specifications.
